Hi Paul,

I can't speak for Dirk's wishes regarding his Python implementation, but I'm
fine with my original JavaScript or C# Excel formula parser code being
released with a BSD/MIT license, as long as proper attribution is provided
and there's a clear indication that the software is provided "as is",
without warranty of any kind.

Good luck!

Hi, I was wondering if you would be OK with the parser (specifically the
Python implementation) being released with an BSD/MIT license?

thanks for the implementation!

I did not write the tokenizing/parser code and don't hold the copyright to
it.
Eric did and I just applied a small patch and integrated it. See the header
of tokenizer.py.
